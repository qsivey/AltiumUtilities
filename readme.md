Altium Utilities
================

This is an Altium Designer library that contains grafical symbols, component footprints, project templates and rules. There are the two library types - multi-color symbols for advanced schematic design and classic symbols for standard project engineering.

## Rules

- Component parameters order: Name, Value, other parameters, Case, Part Number, Link and Note;

- A first pin of any element (sch and pcb) is located at origin;

- PCB Overlay and Draw layer: 0.2mm (0.15mm for tiny elements));

- All strings font ratio: 5:1;

- H - Height, L - Length, P - Pitch;

- MM units priority (Mils for only mils components);

- See the _colorRules.txt and _colorRulesScheme.png in Libraries/ColoredSymbols for examine the multi-color design.

## 3D Models
