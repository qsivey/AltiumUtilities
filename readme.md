Altium Utilities
================

This is an Altium Designer library that contains grafical symbols, component footprints, project templates and rules. There are the two library types - multi-color symbols for advanced schematic design and classic symbols for standard project engineering.

## Rules

- Component parameters order: Name, Value, other parameters, Case, Part Number, Link and Note;

- A first pin of any element (sch and pcb) is located at origin;

- PCB Overlay and Draw layer: 0.15mm, 0.2mm and 0.25mm thickness;

- All strings font ratio: 5:1;

- Custom 3D cases colors: black color = #1C1C1C, dark-gray color = #222222;

- H - Height, L - Length, S - Step;

- MM units priority (Mills for only mills components);

- See the _colorRules.txt and _colorRulesScheme.png for examine the multi-color design.
